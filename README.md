# Software Designer and Developer

Iâ€™m a full stack software designer and developer, specialized in but not limited to web applications, and an advocate for driving implementation and ensuring quality through automated testing methodologies.

Focused on event-driven/service-oriented architectures and serverless/IaC approaches, strongly experienced in object oriented programming, very knowledgeable in functional/reactive paradigms and long-time enthusiast of machine learning.

I've studied electronics, written my first code on a VIC 20 and, during 1999, after a lot of experimentation with neural networks, finally recognized software as my passion and understood that it would have been my future.

After that, during 25+ years, I've worked in various contexts and roles contributing to the design and development of many systems as well as to the support and mentorship of many engineers through pair programming and individual contribution.
